@Open Access Data

1. available codes refer to the process of modeling each species distribution. Codes about incertainty measurements and other procedures such as plotting the data can be available upon request.
2. 'raw_data.csv' refers to all locations obtained from databases.
3. 'spatial_thinned_points.csv' refers to our final data set.
